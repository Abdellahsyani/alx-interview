# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation
*  UTF-8 is a widely used encoding system for representing Unicode code points in binary format


* For the “0x04. UTF-8 Validation” project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:

## Concepts Needed:

* [Python Bitwise Operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators)
* [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
* [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)
* [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)
* [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

* By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project, effectively applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
